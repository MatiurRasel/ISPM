::> The .nvmrc file is used to specify the Node.js version for a project 
when using Node Version Manager (NVM). NVM is a version manager for Node.js 
that allows you to easily switch between different versions of Node.js 
on your machine.

The .nvmrc file typically contains a single line specifying the desired 
Node.js version. For example: (20)

 is the specific version of Node.js that the project requires. 
 When you run commands like nvm use or nvm install in the project directory, 
 NVM will read the .nvmrc file and automatically switch or install the 
 specified Node.js version.

 Having an .nvmrc file is particularly useful when multiple projects have 
 different Node.js version requirements. It helps maintain consistency 
 across different development environments.

 This command will read the .nvmrc file in the current directory and 
 use the specified Node.js version. 
 If the version is not installed, NVM will prompt you to install it.
